## ![](./icons/icon48.png) Form2JSON

  
A chrome extension i wished it was already created,
This extension let's you **save** fields values from forms into a JSON file so you can come back later and take a look at what you submitted in the past.

### Installation
To install this extension visit [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jpjmnnajkdnipddclaaeobnecehomnbe).

### Features
* Source URL.
* All fields Values.

* Others(check the generated JSON file!).


### TODO
* Improve the solution.
* Add new Features. 


### Credits
I want to thank [devtools-snippets](https://github.com/bgrins/devtools-snippets/) contributors, it is really a helpful ressource for this extension(used some parts of it so i don't have to reimpliment them).
